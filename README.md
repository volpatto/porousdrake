# Porousdrake

This project contains some reproducible Python scripts using [Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/)
 framework to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) from a Python interface.

 In the present case, I solve Darcy flow problems related to my Doctoral research.
 The main subject of my research is suitable hybridizable Finite Element Methods (FEM) for
 Multiscale Darcy Flow problems (multiporosity/multipermeability). Specifically, I want to propose new Mixed Hybrid FEM to
 solve such problems, either using Continuous or Discontinuous Galerkin approximations.
